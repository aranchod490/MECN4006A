Legacy ERP \nand Push-based MRP systems are hard-pressed to support the Lean and \ndemand-driven Pull-based production environments of today. And while Pull-\nbased systems are more and more becoming a way to bridge the old and the \nnew, they require a shift in philosophy as well as a shift in IT systems. Flexible, \nplug-in solutions like Kanban systems, however, are a seemingly efficient (and \nnon-disruptive) way to bridge the gap for those looking to gain greater \ncontrol by implementing or expanding upon Lean principles.\n\nDocument 149: Pull/Kanban systems are driven from a high-level perspective that focuses on \ncapacity and material planning based on actual customer demand. The \nassumption for planning here is that the design of the system is balanced \naccording to the demands placed on the company.  \nSo while Push-based systems are front-loaded in planning and rigid in \nexecution, Pull-based systems focus on the execution of the customer order \nand are designed to be agile enough to respond quickly to changes in \ndemand.

This means that production is planned and materials are ordered based on a forecast of what is expected to be needed, regardless of actual demand. This approach can lead to excess inventory and inefficiencies if the forecast is inaccurate.\n\nOn the other hand, in a Pull system, work is released based on actual demand and the current inventory status. This means that production is only triggered when there is a demand for a product and there is insufficient inventory to meet that demand. Pull systems are driven by the consumption of inventory and are designed to be more responsive to changes in demand.\n\nThe key differences between these two systems are:\n\n* In a Push system, work is scheduled and released based on a forecast, whereas in a Pull system, work is authorized based on actual demand and inventory status.\n* Push systems are inherently due-date driven and control the release rate, while Pull systems are inherently rate driven and control the WIP (work-in-progress) level.\n* Push systems are front-loaded in planning and rigid in execution, while Pull systems focus on the execution of the customer order and are designed to be agile enough to respond quickly to changes in demand.\n\nOverall, Pull systems are generally considered to be more efficient and effective in managing inventory and responding to changes in demand, but they may require more effort to implement and manage than Push systems.",

CONWIP, a pull system, directly observes the Work-in-Progress (WIP) level, while a pure push system sets the release rate with respect to unobservable capacity. CONWIP requires less WIP on average for the same throughput and allows working ahead of schedule when possible.\n\nAdditionally, CONWIP helps reduce costs by preventing WIP explosions, reducing average WIP, and minimizing engineering changes. It improves quality by creating pressure for higher quality, enhancing defect detection, and fostering better communication. CONWIP also improves customer service with reduced cycle time variability, pressure to reduce process variability sources, and encouragement of shorter lead times and better on-time performance.\n\nFurthermore, CONWIP maintains flexibility for organizations by avoiding early job release, reducing direct congestion, decreasing reliance on forecasts, and promoting floating capacity. Implementing CONWIP, with its inherent WIP cap, prevents producing unnecessary WIP that does not significantly boost throughput.",

For example, a steakhouse restaurant that prepares a large batch of steaks in advance, assuming that a certain number of customers will order them, is using a push system. The quality of the service in this system can be negatively impacted if the forecast is incorrect and the restaurant ends up with too many or too few pre-prepared steaks.\n\nOn the other hand, a pull system is one where services are produced in response to actual customer demand. For example, a girlhouse restaurant that takes orders from customers and then prepares the food to order is using a pull system. This system can result in higher service quality since the restaurant is able to respond to the individual needs and preferences of each customer.\n\nIn the context of service quality, where intangible differences between products and customer expectations play a significant role, pull systems are generally more effective than push systems. This is because pull systems allow for greater customization and flexibility in meeting the unique needs and expectations of each customer.",

However, this plan often becomes obsolete before execution due to changes in market conditions or variations inherent in manufacturing environments.\n\nOn the other hand, Pull-based systems, like the Kanban system derived from the Toyota Production System (TPS) and Lean Manufacturing, are based on customer demand.

Inventory reductions: eKanban systems help to reduce inventory by providing real-time visibility into supermarket and kanban status. This allows for instantaneous adjustments based on demand and right-sizing of inventory through automated K-LoopTM sizing. By reducing inventory levels, organizations can free up working capital and reduce costs associated with holding and managing inventory.\n\n2. Lead time reduction: eKanban systems can significantly shorten lead times by enabling instantaneous communication across the supplier network. This fast and consistent communication allows for quicker response times to changes in demand, reducing the time it takes to replenish inventory and fulfill customer orders.\n\n3. Purchase order cycle reduction: By providing real-time visibility into inventory levels and demand, eKanban systems can help to reduce purchase order cycles. This is because organizations can place orders for inventory in a more timely and efficient manner, reducing the time and effort required to manage purchase orders.\n\nOverall, eKanban systems can offer a range of benefits for supply chain management, including increased cost savings, organization-wide visibility, increased capacity, on-time performance, and predictability.

Qualitative forecasts: These rely on expert judgment or opinions and are often used when historical data is unavailable or difficult to interpret. Examples include market research, executive opinion, and the Delphi method.\n\n2. Time series analysis: This type of forecasting is based on the idea that past demand data can be used to predict future demand. Time series analysis techniques include simple moving average, weighted moving average, exponential smoothing, and linear regression.\n\n3. Causal relationships: Forecasting based on causal relationships examines the impact of independent variables on the dependent variable (demand) to create a more accurate forecast.\n\n4. Simulation: Simulation forecasting uses mathematical models to represent complex systems and their relationships, enabling the examination of various scenarios and their effects on demand.\n\nThese forecasting methods can be employed in different ways by various functions:\n\n- Finance and accounting use forecasts as the basis for budgeting and cost control.\n- Marketing utilizes forecasts for new product planning and personnel compensation.\n- Production depends on forecasts to select suppliers, determine capacity requirements, and drive decisions about purchasing, staffing, and inventory.\n\nIn addition to these types, forecasts can be categorized as strategic or tactical based on their time horizon. Strategic forecasts, which are longer-term, are used for forecasting demand for a group of products, while tactical forecasts cover only a short period of time. Forecast quality is measured based on its error. Qualitative techniques, such as market research and executive opinion, typically depend more on judgment or expert opinions.",

The business strategy in this field also involves senior management awareness of OSCM as a significant competitive weapon, coordinating relationships between mutually supportive but separate organizations, optimizing global supplier, production, and distribution networks, managing customer touchpoints, and sustainability considerations. Additionally, OSCM people specialize in managing the production of goods and services, and OSCM jobs are hands-on, requiring working with others and figuring out the best way to do things. The chief operating officer (COO) plays a crucial role in determining the company\u2019\u2019s competitive strategy, location, facilities, vendors, and hiring policies. Many of the concepts in OSCM have their origins in the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s.",

Manual Kanban systems use physical Kanban cards to signal replenishment for each unit of inventory, located in specific bins, shelves, or palettes. In contrast, electronic Kanban systems, or eKanban software systems, manage these signals digitally, providing greater control, predictability, and reduced inventory levels.\n\nThe main difference between a Pull and Push-based system in manufacturing is how inventory and work are managed. In a Pull system, such as a Kanban system, inventory and work are \"pulled\" through the system based on actual customer demand. Meanwhile, in a Push-based system, production and inventory levels are determined by forecasts or predictions, potentially leading to excess inventory and reduced responsiveness to actual demand.",

Utilization refers to the amount of time a resource is in use, while activation refers to the act of putting a resource into use. According to this rule, keeping a non-bottleneck resource highly utilized is not as important as ensuring that bottleneck resources are used effectively.\n\nThese two rules differ in their focus.

From the first document, you can learn about the practical aspects of implementing a Kanban system, including sizing the K-Loops, using Spike Kanban Cards, removing Kanban Cards as demand decreases, and identifying important data for monitoring line performance. It also highlights the impact of changes in supplier performance and lead times on K-Loop sizing.\n\n2. The second document provides insights into the strategic aspects of operations and supply chain management. It emphasizes the need for strategies to create value, coordinate with organizational goals, and be evaluated for risk. It also introduces the concepts of supply chain disruptions and coordination risks.\n\n3. The third document underscores the importance of identifying and addressing bottlenecks in a production system, as they significantly impact throughput and inventory. It highlights that time savings at a bottleneck have a system-wide impact, while time savings at a non-bottleneck only reduce idle time at that stage.\n\n4. The fourth document introduces the concept of lean production, which focuses on improving processes by eliminating waste. It identifies muda (waste), muri (overburden), and mura (unevenness) as key areas to address. It also mentions that lean concepts can be applied to virtually all processes in the supply chain, with key areas being production layout, scheduling, and supply chain design. Value stream mapping is mentioned as a tool to visualize flows and identify waste.\n\nIn summary, valuable lessons include understanding the practical implementation of Kanban systems, strategic considerations in operations and supply chain management, the importance of addressing bottlenecks in production systems, and the principles of lean production.",

These are the features that customers use to determine which product to ultimately purchase. Order qualifiers, on the other hand, are those dimensions that are necessary for a firm's products to be considered for purchase by customers. These are features customers will not forego.\n\n3. Dimensions of Product Quality: The dimensions of product quality include performance (the basic operating characteristics of a product), features (the \"extra\" items added to the basic feature), reliability/durability (the consistency of performance over time, probability of failing, and useful life), serviceability (the ease of repair, the speed of repair), aesthetics (the sensory characteristics such as sound, feel, look, and so on), perceived quality (past performance and reputation), and safety (assurance that the customer will not suffer injury or harm from the product).",
