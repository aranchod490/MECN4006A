Legacy ERP \nand Push-based MRP systems are hard-pressed to support the Lean and \ndemand-driven Pull-based production environments of today. And while Pull-\nbased systems are more and more becoming a way to bridge the old and the \nnew, they require a shift in philosophy as well as a shift in IT systems. Flexible, \nplug-in solutions like Kanban systems, however, are a seemingly efficient (and \nnon-disruptive) way to bridge the gap for those looking to gain greater \ncontrol by implementing or expanding upon Lean principles.\n\nDocument 149: Pull/Kanban systems are driven from a high-level perspective that focuses on \ncapacity and material planning based on actual customer demand. The \nassumption for planning here is that the design of the system is balanced \naccording to the demands placed on the company.  \nSo while Push-based systems are front-loaded in planning and rigid in \nexecution, Pull-based systems focus on the execution of the customer order \nand are designed to be agile enough to respond quickly to changes in \ndemand.

This makes Pull systems more agile and responsive to changes, as they \"pull\" inventory and work through the system only when needed.",

Utilization refers to how effectively a resource is used in the context of the system's constraints, while activation is merely the act of using the resource without considering its impact on the system.
