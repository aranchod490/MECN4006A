We'll move quickly over the basics to focus on the fundamental ideas that make systems\n\nDocument 9: many fundamental ideas behind machine learning, beginners will find the sessions go much faster than what's optimal for them.What does \"lifetime access\" mean?You only pay once to join the program and get immediate access to every past, present, and future cohort.Every new iteration of the program is better than the ones before. Many students take classes once and then join a later cohort to benefit from the updates.The lifetime access removes any pressure from having to complete the program when life gets in the way.Hey! I'm Santiago.I'm the instructor of the program.I'm a machine learning engineer with over two decades of experience building and scaling enterprise software and machine learning systems.I love neural networks. I love to make them work at scale.From 2009 to 2023, I built products for Disney, Boston Dynamics, IBM, Dell, G4S, Anheuser-Busch, and NextEra Energy, among other clients.

We'll move quickly over the basics to focus on the fundamental ideas that make systems\n\nDocument 1: program will help you unlearn what you think machine learning is. It's a practical, hands-on class where you'll learn from years of experience and real-world examples.When you join, you get lifetime access to the following:18 hours of live, interactive sessions. We'll use this time to discuss the first principles behind building machine learning systems.10 hours of step-by-step coding instructions. These practical sessions will show you how to build an end-to-end system from scratch.A final project where you'll build a complete solution and receive direct feedback on your work.100 coding assignments and practice questions.The entire source code of a working production system. It's yours. You can change and use it as you see fit.A private community where you'll collaborate with thousands of people from different backgrounds.Direct access to your instructor.Lifetime access to every past and future cohort.Program certificate upon completion.And the best part is that you only pay once to","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"I am considering joining the Machine Learning School Program."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":2,"topic":"Others"}}
