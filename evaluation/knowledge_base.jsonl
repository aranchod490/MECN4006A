The reason the master schedule \ntime horizon covers the longest cumulative lead time is because you want to \nplan far enough in advance to handle any problems that may occur.

{"text":"11\nAfter the BOM information is accessed, the next information the MRP system \nrequires to complete the planning job is the inventory records. \nThere are two types of inventory records for this discussion: on -hand \ninventory and on -order inventory.\nThe importance of data accuracy becomes more critical due to data \ndependency. The BOM records must be impeccable and inventory records \nmust be pristine. \nMinimally acceptable thresholds for this accuracy require BOM accuracy to be \nat 98%. This means that 98% of the BOMs are perfect."}
{"text":"12\nThe inputs to MRP (the master schedule, BOM, lead times, purchasing, and \ninventory) frequently change. These frequent changes generate what is called \nsystem nervousness and can create havoc in purchasing and production \ndepartments if implemented.

By pegging upward, the production planner can determine the cause for \nthe requirement and make a judgment about the necessity for a change in the \nschedule."}

Closed -loop MRP systems evaluate a proposed \nmaterial plan relative to available capacity. If a proposed plan is not feasible, it \nmust be revised. \nKey outputs of capacity planning include load reports for each work center. \nWhen variances (underloads or overloads) are projected, managers might \nconsider smoothing the load and minimizing the impact of changed lead time \nby: Overlapping, Operations splitting and Order splitting, or lot splitting"}
